    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, allowing control over the data and ensuring that it's accessed and modified only through predefined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential characteristics. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method invocation in a way that's appropriate for their individual types. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes as long as they share a common interface (such as a common method name)."
