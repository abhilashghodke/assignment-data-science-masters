    "\n",
    "An exception in Python refers to an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation is encountered, Python raises an exception, which is an object that represents the error or unexpected condition. Exceptions provide a way to handle errors and unexpected scenarios in a more controlled and organized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nature of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: These occur during runtime when the program is executing. They are typically caused by factors such as invalid user input, incorrect data, file not found, network issues, etc.\n",
    "- Syntax Errors: These occur during the parsing phase, before the program starts executing. They are caused by incorrect syntax in the code, such as missing colons, parentheses, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Error Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: These are detected while the program is running, and they may not always lead to an immediate program termination if not handled.\n",
    "- Syntax Errors: These are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts executing, and they prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: Python provides mechanisms (try-except blocks) to catch and handle exceptions, allowing the program to gracefully respond to unexpected situations without crashing.\n",
    "- Syntax Errors: Since these are detected before execution, they need to be fixed in the code itself before running the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: Examples include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, ValueError, etc.\n",
    "- Syntax Errors: Examples include missing colons (SyntaxError: invalid syntax), mismatched parentheses (SyntaxError: unmatched ')'), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Impact on Program Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: Handled exceptions can allow the program to continue executing after encountering an error, or they can lead to program termination if not properly handled.\n",
    "- Syntax Errors: These prevent the program from even starting execution until the syntax issues are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors that can occur in Python programs, but they occur at different stages of the program's lifecycle and have distinct characteristics in terms of when they are detected and how they are handled."
