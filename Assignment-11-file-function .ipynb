    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It allows you to specify the filename and the mode in which you want to open the file. The different modes available for opening a file are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'r' (Read Mode): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError. If the file exists, the pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'w' (Write Mode): It opens the file for writing. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. If the file exists, its contents are truncated (erased) before writing new data. Use with caution as it can delete the existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'a' (Append Mode): It opens the file for writing, but in append mode. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. If the file exists, the pointer is positioned at the end of the file, and new data is added without erasing the existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used along with other modes, like 'rb' or 'wb'. It indicates that the file should be opened in binary mode, which is used for non-text files (e.g., images, audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode): It opens the file for writing but only if the file doesn't exist. If the file exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 't' (Text Mode): This is the default mode for text files. It's used along with other modes, like 'rt' or 'wt', to indicate that the file should be treated as a text file.\n",

    "The close() function in Python is used to close an open file. It's important to close a file after you've finished reading from or writing to it. Closing a file releases the resources associated with the file, which can include system-level resources such as file handles and memory buffers. Failing to close a file properly can lead to various issues and resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why it's important to close a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resource Management: When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain resources to manage the interaction with the file. These resources include file handles, memory buffers, and system-level locks. If you don't close the file, these resources may not be released until the program terminates, potentially leading to inefficient resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Integrity: When writing to a file, data might be buffered in memory before actually being written to the physical file on disk. If you don't close the file, the buffered data might not be flushed to the file, causing potential data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. File Locking: Some operating systems impose file-level locks to prevent multiple processes from simultaneously accessing the same file. If you don't close the file, the lock might not be released, preventing other processes from accessing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Maximum Open Files: Most operating systems have a limit on the number of files that can be open simultaneously. Failing to close files properly can lead to hitting this limit and preventing your program from opening more files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that files are properly closed, it's recommended to use the with statement when opening files. The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the with context exits, even if an exception is raised."
