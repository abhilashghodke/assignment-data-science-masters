Here's a brief overview of each test and an example scenario for their use:\n",

    "**T-test:**\n",

You have two groups: a control group that receives a placebo and a treatment group that receives the new drug. You measure the blood pressure of individuals in both groups after a certain period and want to determine if there is a significant difference in mean blood pressure between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-test:**\n",

This could result in the company missing out on valuable improvements to their manufacturing process.\n",

The confidence interval is typically expressed as a range of values, with an associated confidence level indicating the probability that the true parameter lies within that range.\n",
