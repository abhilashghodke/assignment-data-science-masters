Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python until he stepped down as the \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL) in July 2018. Since then, Python's development has been overseen by the Python Steering Council, a group of core developers."

    "Python is a versatile programming language that supports various programming paradigms, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The main programming paradigms supported by Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imperative Programming: \n",
    "This is the most common programming paradigm, where you write code that specifies the steps to be taken to achieve a result. Python's syntax and structure make it well-suited for writing imperative code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): \n",
    "Python supports object-oriented programming by allowing you to define classes and create objects with methods and attributes. This paradigm encourages organizing code into reusable and modular classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional Programming: \n",
    "Python supports functional programming concepts like first-class functions, higher-order functions, and lambda expressions. You can write code in a functional style, treating functions as first-class citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Procedural Programming: \n",
    "Python allows you to structure your code using procedures, functions, and modules. While Python is not purely procedural, you can write code in a procedural manner if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scripting: \n",
    "Python is often used for scripting tasks due to its concise and readable syntax. It's commonly used for automating repetitive tasks, text processing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Dynamic Programming: \n",
    "Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. This flexibility allows for rapid development and easy prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Programming: Python enforces structured programming principles through its indentation-based syntax. This helps improve code readability and maintainability."
