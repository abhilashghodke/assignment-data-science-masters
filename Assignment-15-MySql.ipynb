    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows efficient retrieval, updating, and manipulation of information. Databases are used to store various types of data, such as text, numbers, images, and more, in a structured format to facilitate data management and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on a relational model, which organizes data into structured tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "- They use a query language called SQL to manipulate and retrieve data. SQL provides powerful capabilities for filtering, sorting, joining, and aggregating data.\n",
    "- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are commonly associated with SQL databases, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "- SQL databases are often preferred for applications with well-defined schemas, complex queries, and transactions that require strict data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and are more flexible in terms of data schema.\n",
    "- They come in various types, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases, each optimized for specific use cases.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases often sacrifice some of the ACID properties in favor of improved scalability and performance, making them suitable for applications with high volume, velocity, and variety of data.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are commonly used in scenarios like real-time analytics, content management systems, social networks, and applications dealing with large amounts of data from various sources.\n",
    "- Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases lie in their data model, querying languages, schema flexibility, and trade-offs between consistency and scalability. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements of the application, the nature of the data, and the desired trade-offs between data consistency and system performance."

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each row (record) in that table. It serves as a means of ensuring data integrity and providing a way to uniquely reference each record. Each table can have only one primary key, and its values must be unique and non-null across all rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "2. Non-null: Primary key values cannot be null or empty. They must have meaningful values for identification.\n",
    "3. Stability: Primary key values should be relatively stable and not subject to frequent changes.\n",
    "4. Immutable: Changing the value of a primary key is generally discouraged because it can lead to data integrity issues and complications in referencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a \"Students\" table with columns \"StudentID,\" \"FirstName,\" \"LastName,\" and \"DOB.\" Here, \"StudentID\" could be chosen as the primary key. Each student's ID is unique, and it identifies each student's record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two different tables. It creates a relationship between these tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, creating a way to associate data between the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. References Primary Key: The foreign key column(s) in one table references the primary key column(s) in another table.\n",
    "2. Maintains Data Integrity: Foreign keys help maintain referential integrity, ensuring that data remains consistent across related tables.\n",
    "3. Enforces Relationships: Foreign keys enforce relationships between tables, preventing the insertion of invalid or inconsistent data.\n",
    "4. May Allow NULLs: While primary keys cannot contain NULLs, foreign keys may allow NULL values to represent optional relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Building upon the \"Students\" table example, let's introduce another table named \"Courses\" with columns \"CourseID,\" \"CourseName,\" and \"InstructorID.\" If \"InstructorID\" in the \"Courses\" table is intended to reference the \"StudentID\" in the \"Students\" table, \"InstructorID\" would be a foreign key. This establishes a relationship between students and the instructor of each course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies records within a single table, while a foreign key establishes relationships between records in different tables by referencing the primary key of another table. These concepts are fundamental to maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient data querying and manipulation in relational databases."

    "HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter grouped data based on conditions. It's similar to the WHERE clause but applies to aggregated data after the GROUP BY clause.\n",

    "SELECT: The SELECT clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the result set. It's applied after all the previous clauses have filtered and organized the data.\n",

    "LIMIT/OFFSET: Depending on the database system, you might have a LIMIT (or equivalent) clause that restricts the number of rows returned. Additionally, there might be an OFFSET clause to skip a certain number of rows.\n",

    "UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT: If you're using set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT, they are applied after all the previous clauses to combine or filter result sets.\n",
